# Home App Test Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed overview of the test cases written for the **Home** app in the Django project. It includes test cases for different components of the app such as views, URLs, models, admin, and forms. These tests ensure that the app works as expected and that any changes to its code are thoroughly validated. 

The purpose of these tests is to:

- Ensure that the application functions correctly under different scenarios.
- Verify the integrity of the appâ€™s components (views, models, etc.).
- Provide confidence in the stability of the system as it grows and changes.

The following sections break down the various test areas of the Home app, explaining what is being tested and how the tests help to maintain the app's quality.


## Test Cases Overview

#### Test Steps:

- **Valid Form Submission**:
  1. Simulate a valid `POST` request with the required data (e.g., `barber_name`, `barber_shop`, etc.).
  2. Check that a new `Collaboration` object is created in the database.
  3. Ensure a success message is added to the response.
  4. Verify that the user is redirected to the **About** page.

- **Invalid Form Submission**:
  1. Simulate a `POST` request with invalid or incomplete data (e.g., missing `barber_name` or `barber_shop`).
  2. Verify that the form is not saved.
  3. Ensure the appropriate error message is shown to the user.
  4. Ensure the user is not redirected.

#### Expected Outcome:

3. Check that the API key is properly embedded in the rendered template.

#### Expected Outcome:
- The `maps_api` context variable contains the correct API key, and it's available in the template.

---

### 4. **Collaboration Form Validation (Custom Validation)**

#### Objective:
Test that the `CollaborationForm` correctly handles custom validation logic, especially for uniqueness of `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.

#### Test Steps:
1. Create a `Collaboration` object with a specific `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
2. Simulate a `POST` request to create another collaboration with the same `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
3. Verify that the form validation prevents submission due to the unique constraint on `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.

#### Expected Outcome:
- A validation error is raised for the duplicate `barber_name` and `barber_shop` combination, and the form is not saved.

---

## Template Context Verification

### Objective:
Ensure that the correct context is passed from the view to the template.

#### Test Steps:
1. Send a `GET` request to the `/about/` URL.
2. Check that the context data includes:
   - `abouts`: List of `About` model instances.
   - `collaborations`: List of `Collaboration` model instances.
   - `forms`: A valid instance of `CollaborationForm`.

## 2. **`Collaboration` Model Tests**

### Objective:
Test the functionality of the `Collaboration` model, including field validation, unique constraints, and string representation.

---

### Test Scenarios:

#### 2.1 **Unique Constraint on `barber_name` and `barber_shop`**

##### Test Steps:
1. Create a `Collaboration` object with specific values for `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
2. Try creating another `Collaboration` object with the same `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
3. Verify that a `IntegrityError` is raised due to the unique constraint.

##### Expected Outcome:
- An `IntegrityError` should be raised for duplicate `barber_name` and `barber_shop` combinations, enforcing the uniqueness constraint.

---

#### 2.2 **Field Validation for `Collaboration` Model**

##### Test Steps:
1. Create a `Collaboration` object with valid values for all fields.
2. Create a `Collaboration` object with missing required fields (e.g., `barber_name`, `barber_shop`).
3. Check that an error is raised for the missing required fields.
4. Ensure that optional fields like `more_info` can be left empty.

##### Expected Outcome:
- The `Collaboration` object is saved correctly with valid data, and errors are raised for missing required fields.
- Optional fields like `more_info` should allow for empty values.

---

#### 2.3 **String Representation of `Collaboration` Model**

##### Test Steps:
1. Create a `Collaboration` object with specific `barber_name` and `barber_shop` values.
2. Verify that the string representation of the object returns a string combining `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.

##### Expected Outcome:
- The string representation should return the combination of `barber_name` and `barber_shop` in the correct format.

---

## Test Considerations:

- **About Model**:
  - Ensure that the `About` model correctly handles ordering by `created_on` when querying for about sections.
  - Verify that all fields in the `About` model enforce proper validation.
  
- **Collaboration Model**:
  - Test that the unique constraint on `barber_name` and `barber_shop` is properly enforced.
  - Ensure that required fields are validated and optional fields, like `more_info`, are handled as expected.
  - Test string representation to ensure it displays the correct information about the collaboration request.

# Test Documentation: CollaborationForm Tests

## Overview
These tests aim to verify the functionality and validation of the `CollaborationForm` within the **About app**. The form handles requests for collaboration opportunities from users, including barbers, hair stylists, and beauty salons. The tests will ensure that the form behaves correctly in various scenarios.

---

### **Test Case 1: Valid Form Submission**

#### **Purpose:**
Verify that the form submits successfully with valid data.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Create a set of valid data for all required fields (e.g., `barber_name`, `barber_shop`, `business_type`, `service_offered`, `email`, `number`).
- Submit the form with this data.
- Ensure that the form is valid and can be saved.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should be valid, and the data should be saved to the database as a new `Collaboration` object.

---

### **Test Case 2: Duplicate Collaboration (Unique Constraint)**

#### **Purpose:**
Ensure that the form validates and prevents duplicate submissions for the same `barber_name` and `barber_shop` combination.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Create a `Collaboration` entry with a specific `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
- Submit a second form with the same `barber_name` and `barber_shop`.
- Check for form validation errors related to the `barber_name`.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should show an error for `barber_name` indicating that a collaboration with the same barber name and shop already exists.

---

### **Test Case 3: Invalid Email Format**

#### **Purpose:**
Test if the form correctly handles an invalid email format.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Provide an invalid email (e.g., "invalid-email").
- Submit the form.
- Ensure that the form is invalid and shows an appropriate error message for the email field.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should be invalid, and the email field should return an error indicating the email format is incorrect.

---

### **Test Case 4: Missing Required Fields**

#### **Purpose:**
Test if the form displays errors when required fields are left empty.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Submit the form with some required fields left empty (e.g., `barber_name`, `barber_shop`).
- Check for validation errors on the required fields.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should be invalid, and the required fields should return errors indicating that they are mandatory.

---

### **Test Case 5: Field Placeholder and Widget Check**

#### **Purpose:**
Verify that the fields have the correct placeholder text and input widgets.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Render the form in a template.
- Inspect the HTML to ensure the fields (`barber_name`, `barber_shop`, `email`, `number`) contain the correct placeholder text (e.g., "Enter Your Name", "Enter Barber Shop Name").

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should display the correct placeholder text for each field.

---

### **Test Case 6: Invalid Phone Number Format**

#### **Purpose:**
Test if the form correctly handles an invalid phone number format.

#### **Test Steps:**
- Provide an invalid phone number (e.g., containing letters or symbols).
- Submit the form.
- Ensure that the form is invalid and shows an appropriate error message for the phone number field.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
The form should be invalid, and the phone number field should return an error indicating the format is incorrect.

---

## Conclusion
These tests ensure that the `CollaborationForm` functions as expected, handling both valid and invalid input scenarios. Proper validation for unique collaborations, field formats, and required fields will provide a seamless experience for users submitting collaboration requests.

# Test Plan for About App URLs

### Purpose:
Test the URL routing and view handling for the **About** app, ensuring that the `about_me` view is correctly mapped to the root URL.

--- 

This is the pep8 test of the urls.py file and it returned no error
  ![](about_pep8/app_files//about_urls.png)

---

This is testcase steps and what to test and how 

## 1. **Testing URL Routing for `about_me` View**

### Objective:
Ensure that the URL pattern for the `about_me` view is correctly mapped and resolves as expected.

---

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1.1 **Accessing the About Page**

##### Test Steps:
1. Open the browser or use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to make a GET request to the root URL (`/`).
2. Verify that the request is routed to the `about_me` view.

##### Expected Outcome:
- The root URL (`/`) should correctly route to the `about_me` view.
- The response should return the appropriate HTML content for the **About** page.

---

#### 1.2 **Check URL Pattern Name**

##### Test Steps:
1. In the Django project, ensure the URL pattern name `about` is correctly associated with the `about_me` view.
2. Use Djangoâ€™s `reverse` function or `{% url %}` template tag to ensure the name `about` correctly resolves to the root URL.

##### Expected Outcome:
- The URL pattern should correctly resolve when using the name `about` in templates or views.

---

#### 1.3 **Testing Redirect for Undefined URLs**

##### Test Steps:
1. Make a GET request to an undefined URL (e.g., `/undefined/`).
2. Verify that a 404 error or redirect occurs, as no matching URL pattern exists.

##### Expected Outcome:
- A 404 error should be returned for any undefined URL, confirming that only valid URL patterns are routed.

---

## Test Considerations:

- **URL Routing**:
  - Verify that the root URL (`/`) correctly routes to the `about_me` view.
  - Ensure that the URL pattern is named `about` and resolves correctly with `{% url 'about' %}` in templates or `reverse('about')` in views.
  - Test for 404 errors for undefined URLs to ensure proper routing handling.

This is the pep8 test of the views.py file and it needed to change some pep8 errors
  ![](about_pep8/test_files/about_urls_test.png)


And this is the result of the forms file it passed both the app file and test file tests on pep8

This is the pep8 test of the forms.py file
